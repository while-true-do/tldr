## Vision

We as contributors and maintainers want to establish a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment:

-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Focusing on what is best for the community
-   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants:


-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

## Responsibility

Project maintainers are responsible for clariying the standards of acceptable behaviour. They are expected to take corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to the Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at hello@while-true-do.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html>
