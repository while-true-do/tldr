# Commit Template

```
Commit-Type: Subject of max. 50 characters

The body is about more detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 80
characters or so. Please don't be so poethic. In most cases the linked issue should
be related and explaining.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines, if needed.

 - Bullet points are okay, too.
 - A hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single space and can
   be wrapped around.

 - Resolves: #12
 - See also: #33, #44
```
